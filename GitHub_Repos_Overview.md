## Repository Integration Strategy

### Cross-Repository Communication

**Strategy:** Each repository has its own Discord channel, but they can communicate through:

1. **OpenClaw Coordination:**
   - Use OpenClaw agents to coordinate development across repositories
   - Share business context between repositories
   - Unified monitoring and alerting

2. **Shared Documentation:**
   - Link to documentation from other repositories in each repo's docs channel
   - Create cross-reference guides

3. **Unified Roadmap:**
   - Each repository's roadmap should align with overall $1B journey
   - Dependencies between repositories should be tracked
